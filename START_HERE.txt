## 💡 HELPFUL TIPS

### Tip 1: Open Files Easily
Instead of remembering paths, just drag the file into VS Code from explorer, or:
```powershell
# From project root
code cms/strapi-main/scripts/NEXT_STEPS.txt

# Or navigate first
cd cms/strapi-main/scripts
code NEXT_STEPS.txt
```

### Tip 2: Copy Commands from Files
All files have code blocks you can copy directly:
- In VS Code: Click "Copy" button on code blocks
- Or: Select text and Ctrl+C

### Tip 3: Understand the Structure
- **Documentation files**: Text files for reading (*.txt, *.md)
- **Script files**: JavaScript/PowerShell for running (*.js, *.ps1)
- **Config files**: JSON for configuration (*.json)

### Tip 4: Use Ctrl+P to Quick Open
```
Ctrl+P in VS Code, then type filename:
- NEXT_STEPS.txt
- TROUBLESHOOTING
- SESSION_SUMMARY
- register-content-types
```
