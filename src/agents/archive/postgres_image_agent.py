Original PostgreSQLImageAgent from src/agents/content_agent/agents/postgres_image_agent.py
Now consolidated into unified ImageService

This file was an improved version of ImageAgent that:
- Stored image metadata directly to PostgreSQL
- Eliminated Strapi/GCS dependencies
- Provided async image processing
- Fallback support for placeholder images

Now fully integrated into unified ImageService with:
- Complete async/await support
- Photographer attribution from Pexels
- Automatic PostgreSQL persistence
