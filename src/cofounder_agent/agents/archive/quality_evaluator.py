LEGACY - ARCHIVED (600+ lines)

Original QualityEvaluator from src/cofounder_agent/services/quality_evaluator.py
Now consolidated into unified ContentQualityService

This file provided:
- 7-criteria scoring framework (clarity, accuracy, completeness, relevance, SEO, readability, engagement)
- Pattern-based evaluation
- LLM-based evaluation fallback
- Quality history tracking
- Statistical reporting

Now fully integrated into ContentQualityService with:
- Same 7-criteria framework (preserved exactly)
- Pattern-based, LLM-based, and hybrid evaluation modes
- Enhanced PostgreSQL persistence
- Automatic feedback generation
- Improvement suggestions

For reference only. Do not use for new features.
