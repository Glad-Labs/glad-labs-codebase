🤖 GitHub Copilot Instructions for AI Agents
Last Updated: October 24, 2025
Project: Glad Labs AI Co-Founder System v3.0
Status: Production Ready | Type-Safe | Documentation Policy Enforced

🎯 Essential Context for AI Agents
Architecture & Component Boundaries
Glad Labs is a three-tier monorepo orchestrating AI-powered business operations:

Web Tier (React/Next.js)
├── Oversight Hub (port 3001): React dashboard for agent control, model management, cost tracking
├── Public Site (port 3000): Next.js SSG site consuming Strapi content
└── Uses Zustand for state, Material-UI for components

API Tier (FastAPI + Strapi)
├── Co-Founder Agent (port 8000): Central orchestrator routing tasks to specialized agents
├── Multi-agent system: Content, Financial, Market, Compliance agents
├── Model router: Automatic fallback (Ollama → OpenAI → Claude → Gemini)
├── Memory system: Persistent context + semantic search for agent context
└── Strapi CMS (port 1337): Headless content management with TypeScript plugins

Data Tier
├── PostgreSQL: Production data (Strapi collections, audit logs)
├── SQLite: Local development
├── Redis: Caching (planned)
└── Google Cloud: Firestore + Pub/Sub (production integrations)
Key Integration Patterns:

Oversight Hub → FastAPI REST endpoints to orchestrator (tasks, models, health)
FastAPI → Specialized agents (parallel execution via asyncio)
Agents → Strapi API for content CRUD operations
All components → Model router for LLM calls with multi-provider fallback
Logging → Audit middleware captures all state changes
� Critical Development Commands (Reference for AI Implementation)
Starting Services (Workspace is pre-configured)
npm run dev # ✅ Starts Oversight Hub + Public Site (recommended for frontend work)
npm run dev:oversight # React admin dashboard on http://localhost:3001
npm run dev:public # Next.js site on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev:cofounder # FastAPI backend on http://localhost:8000 (port may vary)
npm run dev:strapi # Strapi CMS on http://localhost:1337 (currently has build issues)
Code Quality (MUST run before committing)
npm run lint:fix # Auto-fix ESLint + import sorting
npm run format # Prettier on all files (.js, .jsx, .tsx, .json, .md)
npm test # Jest frontend + pytest Python backend
npm run test:python:smoke # Quick backend smoke tests for rapid iteration
Build & Deploy
npm run build # Build Next.js + React production bundles
npm run build:all # Includes Strapi (will likely fail due to plugin issues)
Key Workspace Commands
npm run setup:all # Install all dependencies (Node + Python)
npm run clean:install # Full reset: rm node_modules + fresh install
npm run install:all # Just npm install across all workspaces
npm run setup:python # Just pip install for backend
� Code Patterns & Conventions (NOT aspirational - these are discovered patterns)
Python Backend Patterns (src/cofounder_agent/)
FastAPI Route Structure (src/cofounder_agent/routes/)

Routes are modular: content_router, models_router, auth_router, enhanced_content_router
All routes injected into main FastAPI app in main.py
Routes depend on orchestrator and database services
PATTERN: Routes handle HTTP validation; orchestrator handles business logic
Orchestrator Pattern (orchestrator_logic.py)

Central Orchestrator class coordinates all agent execution
Async methods for parallel task processing via asyncio.gather()
Multi-provider model routing (Ollama → OpenAI → Claude → Gemini fallback)
KEY FILE: src/cofounder_agent/main.py shows FastAPI setup and route registration
PATTERN: Thin controllers, thick orchestrator
Database Patterns (database.py)

SQLAlchemy models for local SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)
Audit logging middleware wraps all CRUD operations
JWT token storage separate from user model
PATTERN: All DB changes logged to audit_logging.py middleware
Error Handling - Watch for:

Google Cloud integrations optional: try/except ImportError for Firestore/Pub/Sub
Database optional during dev: check DATABASE_AVAILABLE flag before using db
Model provider failures trigger automatic fallback (don't wrap in try/except - router handles it)
React/Next.js Patterns (web/)
Oversight Hub State Management (web/oversight-hub/src/)

Single source of truth: store/useStore.js (Zustand global state)
Theme management: useStore((state) => state.theme) pattern used throughout
PATTERN: Never prop-drill state; use Zustand selectors
Components subscribe to specific store slices: useStore(state => state.singleValue) not entire state
Next.js Public Site Patterns (web/public-site/)

SSG First: Use getStaticProps and getStaticPaths (not SSR for performance)
ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration): revalidate: 3600 for content updates
Strapi API client in lib/api.js (centralized, never scatter API calls)
PATTERN: All Strapi calls go through lib/api.js to enable caching and error handling
Component Organization:

Lightweight presentational components in components/
Business logic in custom hooks or store selectors
Material-UI components preferred (already in dependencies)
PATTERN: No nested components, use composition
Testing Patterns (Already Existing)
Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library

Test location: **tests**/ folders parallel to source
Mock Strapi API responses in tests (don't hit real API)
Example pattern: expect(getByText(...)).toBeInTheDocument()
Backend: pytest for Python

Test location: src/cofounder_agent/tests/
Mock external services (Google Cloud, Strapi, LLMs)
Run with: npm run test:python or npm run test:python:smoke (faster)
⚠️ Known Constraints & Pain Points (For AI Agent Context)
Strapi v5 Build Issues (cms/strapi-main/)

Specific plugin incompatibility with TypeScript configuration
npm run develop fails; avoid assigning Copilot to fix without explicit request
Workaround: Use local SQLite development, deploy PostgreSQL to production
Don't attempt: Deep plugin debugging - this is known limitation
Async/Await Patterns in Python

Backend uses heavy async (FastAPI + asyncio)
All orchestrator methods are async; use await when calling them
Parallel execution via asyncio.gather() - don't use threading
Google Cloud operations non-blocking (Firestore, Pub/Sub async)
Frontend Port Conflicts

Both Oversight Hub and Public Site want port 3000
System auto-assigns next available (3001, 3002) - don't hardcode ports
Verify actual port in terminal output after npm run dev
Environment Variables - Critical!

Local dev: Copy .env.example → .env (never commit .env)
Production secrets: GitHub Secrets + Railway/Vercel dashboards
No production secrets should ever appear in code or docs
Model provider keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are required for backend
� File Organization & Where to Look
Need Look In
FastAPI backend logic src/cofounder_agent/main.py, orchestrator_logic.py, routes/
AI agent implementations src/agents/{content,financial,market_insight,compliance}\_agent/
React admin dashboard web/oversight-hub/src/components/, store/useStore.js
Next.js public site web/public-site/pages/, lib/api.js, components/
Strapi CMS setup cms/strapi-main/src/ (plugin issues - use with caution)
Authentication flow src/cofounder_agent/routes/auth_routes.py, middleware/auth.py
Audit logging src/cofounder_agent/middleware/audit_logging.py (type-safe, 0 errors)
Database models src/cofounder_agent/models.py, database.py
Tests src/cofounder_agent/tests/, \*\*/**tests**/ (Jest)
NPM workspace configs Root package.json (workspaces array)
🤖 For AI Agent Code Generation
DO:
✅ Follow existing async/await patterns in Python backend
✅ Use Zustand selectors for React state (not Context)
✅ Centralize API calls in lib/api.js (Next.js) or route modules (FastAPI)
✅ Write tests alongside code (Jest for JS, pytest for Python)
✅ Use conventional commits: feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.
✅ Add type hints to Python functions (all 20 previous errors now fixed)
✅ Check existing code for patterns before generating new implementations
✅ Reference docs/04-DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md for git workflow
DON'T:
❌ Import from sibling workspaces directly (use published APIs/REST)
❌ Create ANY documentation in the root folder EXCEPT for a single README.md and LICENSE.md
❌ Hardcode API endpoints (use environment variables from .env)
❌ Prop-drill state in React (use Zustand or URL params)
❌ Mix async/sync in Python orchestrator (everything must be async)
❌ Ignore type hints or leave Python functions untyped
❌ Commit secrets, API keys, or unencrypted sensitive data
❌ Modify Strapi plugins without extensive testing (known issues)
❌ Write documentation that becomes stale (keep HIGH-LEVEL ONLY)

High-Level Documentation Policy ⚠️ IMPORTANT
Effective: October 22, 2025

Glad Labs maintains a HIGH-LEVEL ONLY documentation approach to reduce maintenance burden and prevent documentation staleness as the codebase evolves.

DOCUMENTATION CREATED:

✅ Core docs (00-07): Architecture-level, high-level guidance
✅ Components: Only when unique from core docs
✅ Reference: Technical specs, schemas, API definitions
✅ Troubleshooting: Focused, specific issues with solutions
✅ README files: In component folders for local setup
DOCUMENTATION NOT CREATED:

❌ How-to guides for every feature (feature code is the guide)
❌ Status updates or session-specific documents
❌ Duplicate documentation (consolidate into core docs)
❌ Step-by-step tutorials for changing code (too high maintenance)
❌ Outdated historical guides (archive or delete)
❌ Temporary project audit files
PHILOSOPHY: Documentation should answer "WHAT is the architecture?" and "WHERE do I look?" — NOT "HOW do I implement X?" (That changes too fast and code is self-documenting).

MAINTENANCE:

Update core docs (00-07) only when architecture changes
Delete guides that become outdated
Archive historical documents
Keep docs < 8 files in root
Archive > 50 files total in docs/
Update Process
Edit documentation files (core docs 00-07 only, unless exception)
Run markdown linter: .markdownlint.json rules applied
Check links are valid: Run link checker
Commit with docs: prefix
Update "Last Updated" date
DO NOT create guides or status documents
🔄 Common Development Tasks
Add a New Feature
Create feature branch: git checkout -b feature/my-feature
Implement feature with tests
Run test suite: npm run test
Commit with conventional message: feat: add my feature
Push and create PR to dev branch
After merge, feature automatically deployed to staging
After verification, merge dev → main for production
Fix a Bug
Create bugfix branch: git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
Add test case that reproduces bug
Fix bug, verify test passes
Commit: fix: resolve issue description
Follow PR process above
Update Documentation
Edit markdown files in docs/
Verify links are correct
Commit: docs: update documentation topic
No deployment needed - docs are version-controlled
Deploy to Production
Ensure all tests pass on dev
Create PR: dev → main
Code review and approval required
Merge to main (triggers deployment)
Verify in production environment
Tag release: git tag v1.2.3 && git push --tags
🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues
Node.js Version Errors
Problem: "Expected >=18.0.0 <=22.x.x, got 25.0.0" Solution: Use NVM with .nvmrc

nvm use 22
Strapi Build Failures
Problem: Module not found, dependency errors Solution: Clear cache and reinstall

cd cms/strapi-v5-backend
rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock package-lock.json
npm install
npm run develop
FastAPI Import Errors
Problem: "No module named uvicorn" Solution: Verify venv activation

# Activate venv

source .venv/bin/activate # Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate # Windows

# Run from project root (not from src/cofounder_agent)

python -m uvicorn src.cofounder_agent.main:app --reload
Database Connection Issues
Problem: Cannot connect to PostgreSQL Solution: Check connection string and credentials

# Verify .env has correct DATABASE_URL

echo $DATABASE_URL

# Format: postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
