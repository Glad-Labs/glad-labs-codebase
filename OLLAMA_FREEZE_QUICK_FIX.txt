# Quick Fix Reference - Ollama Freeze

## What Was Blocking Your PC?

The frontend was calling:
1. `GET /api/ollama/health` - Block on startup
2. `POST /api/ollama/warmup` - 30-second timeout block on startup

## The Fix

**Removed both blocking calls from `OversightHub.jsx`**

Now loads with default models instantly and NEVER blocks.

## Before vs After

```
BEFORE: Load page → 5 sec freeze → 30 sec freeze → finally works = 35+ seconds
AFTER:  Load page → instantly works! = <1 second
```

## Testing

✅ Load http://localhost:3001 - should load instantly
✅ Change model - should be instant
✅ Send chat - should work normally (first message ~2-5s, then fast)

## If You Want to Manually Check Ollama

```powershell
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/ollama/health

# Warm up a model manually (not auto anymore)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ollama/warmup -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"model":"mistral"}'
```

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Oversight Hub loads instantly, no freezing
