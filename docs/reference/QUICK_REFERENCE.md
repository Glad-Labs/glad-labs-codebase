## 🎯 Your Next Steps

### Choose One:

#### Option A: "Complete Immediately" (Recommended)

I finish the remaining 30% (~2-3 hours):

- Create docs 03-06
- Move existing docs to folders
- Create subfolder READMEs
- Verify all links
- Result: Production-ready documentation

**Action**: Tell me "Complete now"

#### Option B: "I'll Do It Myself"

Use COMPLETION_STATUS.md for step-by-step guide:

- Content sources identified
- Folder targets specified
- Examples provided
- Validation checklist included

**Action**: Review docs/COMPLETION_STATUS.md

#### Option C: "Defer for Later"

Current state is usable:

- Users can start with docs/01 today
- Structure is in place
- All planning is done
- Can complete anytime

**Action**: Continue with other tasks
