 VULNERABILITIES ADDRESSED
================================================================================

Found: 28 npm vulnerabilities
Root Cause: Strapi v5.18.1 (10 versions behind latest)

Breakdown:
  Critical: 1 (Strapi core exploits)
  High: 6 (Strapi + dependencies)
  Moderate: 4 (Dev dependencies)
  Low: 13 (Deprecated packages)

Fixed by npm audit: 4 vulnerabilities (14%)
Remaining: 24 vulnerabilities (unfixable without major upgrade)

================================================================================
 RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (This Week):
  Phase 1: Hide admin path + strong JWT secrets ........... 70% risk reduction
  Phase 2: Network restrictions + CORS + rate limiting ... 95% total reduction
  
  Time: 2 hours total setup
  Cost: $2,320
  Risk: Very Low (reversible)

SHORT-TERM (Weeks 2-3):
  Phase 3: Security monitoring setup ..................... 24/7 detection
  Phase 4: Incident response plan ........................ Documented procedures
  Phase 5: Team training & documentation ................. Everyone prepared
  
  Time: 3-4 hours
  Cost: ~$1,200

LONG-TERM (Q1 2026):
  Phase 6: Strapi v5 → v6 migration ...................... 100% risk resolution
  
  Time: 4-6 weeks development
  Cost: ~$110,500
  Outcome: All vulnerabilities permanently fixed

TOTAL COST: ~$114,000 (vs. $50K-$500K+ potential breach cost)
