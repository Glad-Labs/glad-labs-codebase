## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What We Learned

1. **npm audit limitations**: Can only fix dependencies, not packages themselves
2. **Major upgrades take time**: v5 → v6 requires proper planning (4-6 weeks)
3. **Layered security works**: Multiple controls reduce risk more effectively
4. **Monitoring is essential**: Early detection enables fast response
5. **Documentation prevents panic**: Clear procedures = effective incidents response

### What We Did Right

1. ✅ Analyzed vulnerabilities thoroughly
2. ✅ Identified root cause (Strapi v5.18.1)
3. ✅ Presented clear options
4. ✅ Got leadership decision
5. ✅ Created implementation guides
6. ✅ Documented everything
7. ✅ Planned short-term AND long-term fixes

### What You'll Do Right

1. ✅ Execute Phase 1-2 this week (quick wins)
2. ✅ Set up monitoring (early detection)
3. ✅ Train team (everyone prepared)
4. ✅ Plan upgrade carefully (Q1 2026)
5. ✅ Celebrate completion (well-earned!)
