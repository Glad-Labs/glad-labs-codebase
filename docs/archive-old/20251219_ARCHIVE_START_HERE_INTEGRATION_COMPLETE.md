## User Experience This Week

### Before (Week 1-2)

```
User: "I want to create a blog post"
System: "That will cost $0.006"
(All users get same cost)
```

### After This Week

```
User: "I want to create a blog post"
System: "That will cost $0.006, quality ~78%
        Smart pick: Use Claude for draft
        +$0.04 but +35% quality 👌"
(Personalized to each user)
```

## Key Insights

### Why This Works

```
Week 1: User chooses models
        "I want to pick GPT-4 for better quality"

Week 2: User sees costs
        "Oh wow, GPT-4 costs 10x more than Ollama"

Week 3: System learns + recommends
        "Based on 15 tasks, GPT-4 gives you 90% quality"
        "Ollama only 45%, so worth the cost difference"

Result: User makes INFORMED choices
        Spends money INTENTIONALLY
        Gets TRANSPARENCY competitors don't offer
```

### Competitive Moat

```
Jasper:     "$39/month for everyone"
Copysmith:  "$125/month for teams"
You:        "$10/month + show every $0.01"

They hide costs → Users feel ripped off
You show costs → Users trust you
```
