## 🎓 Key Documentation Principles Applied

### 1. **Architecture-First Approach**

Documentation answers "WHAT is the architecture?" and "WHERE do I look?" — NOT "HOW do I implement X?"

### 2. **Single Source of Truth**

- One place for each concept
- Cross-links instead of duplication
- Archive handles historical context

### 3. **Minimal Maintenance Burden**

- Docs stable between major versions
- Features documented in code, not separate guides
- Status/updates not maintained (stale documentation is worse than no documentation)

### 4. **Developer-Focused**

- Clear entry points for different roles
- Quick start for new developers
- Links to relevant components

### 5. **Zero Tolerance for Duplicates**

- Related content consolidated
- Cross-referenced instead of repeated
- Archive preserves history without clutter

## 🚀 Next Steps for Developers

**If you're new to Glad Labs:**

1. Start with [01-SETUP_AND_OVERVIEW.md](./01-SETUP_AND_OVERVIEW.md)
2. Review [02-ARCHITECTURE_AND_DESIGN.md](./02-ARCHITECTURE_AND_DESIGN.md)
3. Pick your role in the "Learning Paths by Role" section of [00-README.md](./00-README.md)
4. Explore related documentation from there

**If you have questions:**

1. Check [00-README.md](./00-README.md) for navigation guidance
2. Use [troubleshooting/](./troubleshooting/) for common issues
3. Review [reference/](./reference/) for technical specs
4. Check [components/](./components/) for service details

**If documentation is outdated:**

- This should NOT happen (core docs are architecture-stable)
- If it does: Check git log to see when docs last changed
- Features belong in code comments, not separate guides
- Report to team if core documentation (00-07) needs updates
