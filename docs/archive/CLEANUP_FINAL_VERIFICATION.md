## 🎓 Documentation Policy - Now Enforced

**HIGH-LEVEL ONLY Policy:**

Glad Labs maintains only architecture-level, stable documentation that survives code evolution.

**What We Keep:**

- Core docs 00-07 (architecture, deployment, development)
- Component architecture docs (linked to core)
- Technical reference (API specs, standards, schemas)
- Focused troubleshooting (specific issues only)
- Historical archive (for reference)

**What We Don't Keep:**

- Feature implementation guides
- Step-by-step how-to documentation
- Session/status update files
- Phase/milestone reports
- Project audit files
- Temporary analysis

**Why This Matters:**

- Less documentation debt
- Documentation stays relevant
- Lower maintenance burden
- Team focuses on code quality
- Code becomes the source of truth

---

## 🚀 Ready for Production

✅ **Clean** - No unnecessary files
✅ **Organized** - Clear folder structure
✅ **Compliant** - 100% policy adherence
✅ **Maintainable** - Low burden
✅ **Focused** - High-level only
