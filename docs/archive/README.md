Historical reports, analyses, and summaries from previous development phases:

- Codebase analysis reports
- Health check reports
- Code review summaries
- Bug reports and investigations
- File update logs
- Master documentation indices (superseded)

### Implementation Logs (`implementation-logs/`)

Historical implementation summaries and completion reports:

- Cost optimization implementations
- Test implementation summaries
- Phase implementation logs
- Oversight Hub enhancement logs
- Reorganization and setup summaries
- Documentation consolidation logs

## What's Archived Here
