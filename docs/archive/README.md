# 📦 Documentation Archive

This folder contains session-specific artifacts and historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but may have reference value.

## Files

- `20251104-CREWAI_TOOLS_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` - Phase 1 CrewAI integration plan (archived)
- `20251104-TEST_AUDIT_AND_CLEANUP_REPORT.md` - Testing audit report (archived)

## Policy

These files are **NOT** part of the production documentation. They are kept for historical reference only.

The current production documentation is in [`docs/00-README.md`](../00-README.md) and core docs (01-07).

## Why Archive?

Per the HIGH-LEVEL ONLY documentation policy:
- ✅ Session-specific artifacts are archived after project completion
- ✅ Historical reference materials are preserved for context
- ✅ Active documentation stays focused and maintainable
- ✅ Archive prevents outdated files from being referenced

## How to Access Archived Docs

If you need reference information from archived files:

1. Check git history: `git log --all -- docs/archive/`
2. View in git: `git show <branch>:docs/archive/<filename>`
3. Or simply browse the files in this folder
