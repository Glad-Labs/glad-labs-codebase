# GLAD Labs Content Management System (CMS)

This directory contains the Strapi v5 backend for the GLAD Labs website. Strapi is a headless CMS that provides a flexible and powerful API for managing the content of the website, including blog posts, authors, categories, and tags.

This CMS is used as the single source of truth for all content, which is then consumed by the public-facing website and other services.

For more information on how to run the entire system, please see the main [project README.md](../../README.md).
