# Strategic Decision Matrix

## Before We Code, Let's Align on Priorities

**This document will help you make decisions about what to build first.**

---

## Question 1: Revenue Model

### How will you make money?

**Option A: B2B SaaS (Subscription)**

```
User pays per month ($29-99/month)
├─ Predictable revenue
├─ Multi-tenant (share infrastructure)
├─ Need multi-tenancy built-in
└─ Price based on features/usage

System Design Impact:
├─ 🔴 HIGH: Need data isolation
├─ 🔴 HIGH: Need usage tracking
├─ 🟡 MEDIUM: Need billing integration
└─ 🟢 LOW: Cost transparency is selling point

Timeline Impact: +2-3 weeks for multi-tenancy
```

**Option B: Enterprise (Custom Deployments)**

```
Customer deploys themselves ($500-5000/month)
├─ Higher price point
├─ Single-tenant (one customer per instance)
├─ Can self-host or we host for them
└─ Revenue from setup + support

System Design Impact:
├─ 🟢 LOW: Don't need multi-tenancy yet
├─ 🟡 MEDIUM: Need deployment automation
├─ 🟡 MEDIUM: Need customer support tools
└─ 🟢 LOW: Cost transparency built-in

Timeline Impact: No impact, simpler initially
```

**Option C: Marketplace (% of Content Revenue)**

```
We take 10-30% of revenue generated by AI content
├─ Aligned incentives
├─ Only profitable if customers make money
├─ Need revenue tracking integration
└─ Low upfront payment, high long-term

System Design Impact:
├─ 🔴 HIGH: Need financial data integration
├─ 🔴 HIGH: Need revenue tracking
├─ 🟡 MEDIUM: Need payouts system
└─ 🟢 LOW: Cost tracking natural fit

Timeline Impact: +3-4 weeks for financial integration
```

**Option D: Hybrid (All of Above)**

```
Start simple, add revenue models over time
├─ SaaS: Standard tier
├─ Enterprise: Premium tier
├─ Marketplace: Advanced tier
└─ Flexibility as we learn

System Design Impact:
├─ 🔴 HIGH: Complexity
├─ 🔴 HIGH: Billing/tracking
├─ 🟡 MEDIUM: Feature gates
└─ 🟢 LOW: Extensible foundation

Timeline Impact: +4-6 weeks
```

## Question 4: Budget Constraints

### What's your monthly cloud budget?

**Option A: <$100/month (Bootstrap)**

```
Constraints:
├─ Must use local models (Ollama on cheap hardware)
├─ Limited database queries (timing out possible)
├─ No fancy caching (Redis is $10+)
├─ Shared hosting (Railway small tier)

Solutions:
├─ Run Ollama locally on your machine
├─ Use free tier for everything initially
├─ Optimize queries aggressively
└─ Plan to scale later

Current: Railway $20 + Vercel free + APIs
Target: Keep APIs < $50 (use Ollama 80%+)

Impact: Makes local models essential, not optional
```

**Option B: $100-500/month (Realistic Startup)**

```
Constraints:
├─ Can use cloud models when needed
├─ Can afford decent database
├─ Can cache aggressively
├─ Can scale somewhat

Breakdown:
├─ Railway: $50-100
├─ Vercel: $0-20
├─ Database: $10-15
├─ LLM APIs: $30-50 (with smart routing)
├─ Ollama compute: $0-50

Strategy: Mix local + cloud, smart routing

Impact: Allows flexibility, not forced to local models
```

**Option C: $500-2000/month (Growth Stage)**

```
Constraints:
├─ Can use best models always
├─ Can afford premium infrastructure
├─ Scaling is easy
├─ Can hire managed services

Breakdown:
├─ Railway/AWS: $200-500
├─ Database (managed): $100-200
├─ LLM APIs: $200-500 (GPT-4, Claude)
├─ Ollama compute: $100-200
├─ Monitoring/logging: $100-200

Strategy: Best quality, cost optimization secondary

Impact: Can focus on product, not cost optimization
```

## Question 5: Which Feature Should Be First?

### What's your biggest competitive advantage?

**Option A: Cost Tracking (Cost Transparency)**

```
Your Angle: "See exactly what you're paying"

First Steps:
├─ Track per-API-call costs
├─ Show cost breakdown by operation
├─ Calculate cost per blog post
├─ Compare models side-by-side

Why First:
├─ 🟢 Easy to build (1-2 weeks)
├─ 🟢 Immediate value (users see ROI)
├─ 🟢 Differentiator vs competitors
├─ 🟢 Enables smart model selection later

Result: User sees "$0.15 total cost for this blog post"
```

**Option B: Smart Model Selection (Cost Optimization)**

```
Your Angle: "Automatically pick cheapest good model"

First Steps:
├─ Build router (which model for which task?)
├─ Define cost/quality matrix
├─ A/B test different routing strategies
├─ Show savings achieved

Why First:
├─ 🟡 Requires cost tracking first
├─ 🔴 Harder to build (3-4 weeks)
├─ 🟢 Massive competitive advantage
├─ 🟢 30-50% cost reduction immediately

Dependency: Must have cost tracking working
```

**Option C: Multi-Endpoint Publishing (Scale)**

```
Your Angle: "Write once, publish everywhere"

First Steps:
├─ Add LinkedIn endpoint
├─ Add Twitter endpoint
├─ Add Webhook endpoint
├─ Manage publishing status

Why First:
├─ 🟢 Clear value (3-4x content reach)
├─ 🟡 Medium complexity (2-3 weeks)
├─ 🟢 Works with existing pipeline
├─ 🟡 Multiplies ROI (good for fundraising)

Dependency: Blog generation must work
```

**Option D: Metrics Dashboard (Visibility)**

```
Your Angle: "See your business KPIs in one place"

First Steps:
├─ Track posts created (daily, weekly, monthly)
├─ Track total cost spent
├─ Show ROI if possible
├─ Compare periods

Why First:
├─ 🟡 Medium value (nice to see, not critical)
├─ 🟡 Medium complexity (2-3 weeks)
├─ 🟢 Looks professional (good for demo)
├─ 🟢 Needed for fundraising

Dependency: Cost tracking must work
```

## My Recommendation (If You Ask Me)

### If you're bootstrapped and need to prove product-market-fit in 4 weeks:

```
Week 1: Cost Tracking + Smart Model Selection
├─ Build CostTracker service
├─ Build ModelRouter service
├─ Integrate both into pipeline
└─ Show cost breakdown

Result: "Blog posts now cost $0.12 (Ollama) vs $0.45 (GPT-4)"
Impact: 70% cost savings immediately
Time: 1 week

Week 2: Multi-Endpoint Publishing
├─ Add LinkedIn endpoint
├─ Add Twitter endpoint
├─ Show status for each
└─ Schedule publishing

Result: 1 blog → LinkedIn + Twitter + own blog (3x reach)
Impact: 3-4x content ROI
Time: 1 week

Week 3: Metrics Dashboard
├─ Track daily posts
├─ Show cost trends
├─ Show cost per post
└─ ROI if available

Result: Simple dashboard showing business impact
Impact: Impressive to show investors/users
Time: 1 week

Week 4: Polish + Deploy
├─ Fix bugs
├─ Optimize performance
├─ Deploy to production
└─ Get first paying users

Result: Live product
Impact: Revenue!
Time: 1 week
```

**Why This Order?**

1. ✅ Cost tracking = Your main competitive advantage
2. ✅ Smart routing = Proves you can optimize better
3. ✅ Multi-endpoint = Multiplies value (good for demo)
4. ✅ Dashboard = Makes it look professional
